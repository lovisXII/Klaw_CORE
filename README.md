# What holds this git

The purpose of this git is to allow you to use an open source and well documented RISCV core.
The core is a RV32I and has been designed using system verilog. For the verification we used the [riscof framework](https://github.com/riscv-software-src/riscof).\
You can run any rv32i bare-metal programm written in assembly of C on the core.
